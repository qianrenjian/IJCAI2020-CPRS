AAAD4c7	lifestyle	causes	People Told My Daughter With a Disability She Wouldn't Be Able to Do Everything She Does Today	A note to MSN readers: In honor of Disability Day, you can help millions of children facing economic hardship and other disadvantages. At Microsoft News, we're partnering with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to ensure kids and teens have the resources they need   including a safe, supportive environment and caring adult mentors. Donate today to Boys & Girls Clubs to help provide the supplies, safe places, and quality programming and experiences to build great futures. I wish I had a dollar for every time someone told me that diagnosis is just a word. That it doesn't define or limit the child it describes. But a diagnosis is not just a word. A diagnosis is supposed to be information . It's there to help doctors, therapists, agencies, teachers, and families treat or manage a condition. It's there for insurance companies to understand the type of illness and what might help. A diagnosis also brings you into contact with others who share it and who may have already figured out how to deal with it. And it's supposed to help you understand the prognosis. It's supposed to help you prepare. My daughter's diagnosis does none of those things. Hers was exceptionally complicated and is reflective of a long and difficult process. It took us three years of trial and error to get at what was really happening. For the first year of her life, I was told that babies go at their own pace , but by the time she was 14 months old, it was abundantly clear that something was very wrong. An MRI showed a significant malformation of her cerebellum and brain stem. We learned that she has pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2, a very rare and very serious neurological genetic disorder. In nearly all cases of PCH2, the affected child doesn't ever walk, talk, sit up, or eat independently. In nearly all cases, the child struggles even with involuntary function and has seizures and dystonia. In nearly all cases, the child doesn't survive. We were told to expect very little and to prepare for the worst. But Freyja continued to grow and thrive against the odds. We were confused, and so were the members of her growing medical and therapeutic team. When she was 2, her preschool placed her in a class with nonverbal children, but she was determined to learn to speak nonetheless. We increased her speech therapy. With hours and hours of PT, she learned to crawl. By the time she was 3, she was ready to learn to stand. Now she's approaching her seventh birthday . She's outgoing, talkative, and determined to bring you into her world. Her blond hair and big, expressive green eyes captivate you. She engages you in relatively age-appropriate conversation. You might not understand her speech right away, but she's used to that now, so she repeats herself slowly, spelling her name F-R-E-Y-J-A for you in case you don't understand the way she says Fray-ah. She asks you to push her wheelchair or to admire how well she walks in her walker with her leg braces on. But Freyja's extroverted demeanor can be dangerously deceptive; we've been denied services because providers who think she's "just so stinkin' cute" don't understand how seriously affected she is. Having an accurate diagnosis should correct this, but for her, it doesn't. Her cognitive potential is not well understood. Her IEP (Individual Education Plan) seems endless at well over 30 pages long. Her neuropsychological evaluation shows strengths and weaknesses so erratic, and intellectual testing scores so complicated, that we had it revised to include a summary in layman's terms so that schools and even hospitals would understand the rationale behind the recommendations. Her results indicate that she belongs in an inclusive mainstream classroom environment with intensive and year-round supplemental support. In short, Freyja's needs are substantial, but she has few if any of the major symptoms and challenges that other children with this diagnosis have. According to her neurologist, Freyja's brain scans are without a doubt indicative of this particular genetic disorder even though she herself is anything but. This is perplexing to her whole team of doctors, therapists, and educators . . . and us. We're told time and time again by those who know that she simply "shouldn't be this high functioning." Others behave like she's a child whose medical and intellectual fragility should be spoken about in hushed tones and euphemisms. They find her to be a fascinating case, and her growing group of experts want to understand why she has the abilities she does when her brain is as damaged as it is. For me, this isn't fascinating. This is a horror movie. When I tell people about Freyja, they rush to make me feel better , as friends do. "Just love her," they tell me. "Stay in the here and now. Enjoy your time with her. Make the most of every moment. She's your little angel. You show those doctors that this diagnosis means nothing. Your baby is defying the odds every single day. She's lucky to have parents like you. She takes after her mama with that determination." But this kind of well-meaning advice, even from people I love very much, makes me feel isolated and misunderstood. Talking to my friends about these thoughts is often unhelpful and awkward; they want to be supportive, but they don't know what to say , and I'm nearly always sorry I opened my mouth because I know I sound ungrateful. I'm not. It's just that when I watch them with their typically developing children, I get a case of the what-ifs, imagining what my daughter might have been like without this disorder. It's unproductive and depressing. On the other hand, her abilities are so far ahead of the other PCH2 children we've come across that I feel like they aren't quite our people either. I'm grateful for the online support systems I've found so I can learn from those with children older than mine. I want to relate to people who get it. But while her brain scans are so like theirs, my child doesn't really resemble these kids at all. The PCH parents I've come into contact with don't see themselves in me. They take solace in these groups for reassurance and support when their child experiences some horrendously scary symptom or when, as it happens much too frequently, their child dies. I often feel caught in the middle, misunderstood by parents of kids with needs both more severe and less. And yet, I would choose my daughter a thousand times over exactly the way she is. She's better than the world's best cookie; I want to eat every single inch of her sweet, delicious little self. Hearing her giggle is magic. Nothing soothes me after a bad day like her tight hugs and juicy kisses. My heart melts when I watch her at night, her tiny body asleep in her bed. She's blissfully unaware of how medically and scientifically complicated she is. She's just Freyja. As time goes on, I find I'm less and less bitter about her condition and more and more focused on getting her needs met as best as I can. She attains new skills every day. Even listening to her fight with her sister over a toy makes me smile because that's such a developmentally appropriate thing to do! I do live by and large in the present, inspired by her determination, soaking up her enthusiasm for life. Seeing how much she continues to learn and grow gives me very tentative, very guarded hope that she may grow up to live and work independently someday . And then I remember that the overwhelming majority of PCH2 cases are not like hers and wonder if I should instead be preparing for her funeral or whether I'm doing enough to prepare her for life after mine. This is where having a diagnosis should come in handy. But hers is practically useless; what has been documented about it is terrifying, and to all who interact with her, it appears to be ill-fitting. And when the specialists don't understand why her abilities and her neurology are at such odds, it's impossible to know how to feel. I can't expect my friends and acquaintances to know the right things to say . When I use the correct term on her paperwork, school districts assume they can't provide adequate care; they think it's imminently terminal. She's been given medications and equipment that she doesn't need by specialists we assumed we could trust to know more about her brain than we do. Even the experts don't quite know what PCH means and therefore don't know how to treat it; even neurologists who do know what it means don't know how to treat her. She's beaten the odds again and again, and every time she does, I can't help but wonder if and when our luck will run out. I want to tell everyone to just treat her like any other kid, because in spite of it all, she sees herself as an ordinary little girl with some out-of-the-ordinary needs. Recently she walked four city blocks in her walker, which is the farthest she's ever gone. Passersby stopped to say hello or just to watch. One lady smiled down at her. "God bless you!" she exclaimed sweetly. Freyja looked at her in confusion. "But I didn't sneeze," she responded. "I'm just going to the bank with my daddy in my walker." I can't wait to see what she does next. Related Video: Watch kids with disabilities and hospital staff dance In powerful video (provided by Radio.com)

AAAF8qG	lifestyle	lifestylehoroscope	Astrology Ranking Of The Most Dramatic Zodiac Signs To The Least	Is your zodiac sign the most dramatic and attention seeking? 1) Leo Leo is the most dramatic zodiac sign Coming in at number one and the most dramatic is Leo, although that shouldn't really come as a surprise. Leo people love gossiping and creating drama everywhere they go simply because they get a kick out of it. 2) Gemini Gemini thrives on drama As one of the cheekiest and sassiest zodiac signs , the Gemini personality absolutely loves drama and pretty much lives for it. Gemini people love living their lives as if they were in an award-winning telenovela. 3) Pisces Pisces LOVES drama The Pisces personality may come across as sweet and innocent, but don t be fooled because these guys adore drama and love nothing more than being the center of attention. Pisces gets a real buzz from drama! 4) Scorpio Scorpio can't resist drama It's hardly a surprise that the mysterious Scorpio personality likes to spice things up by adding their own touch of drama. Although be warned, if you call a Scorpio out you should expect them to lose their cool; they are one of the angriest zodiac signs after all. 5) Libra Libra is a drama magnet Libra's mantra of balance and harmony flies straight out the window where drama is concerned. Whenever the Libra personality gets a waft of drama, they can't contain themselves and have to get involved. 6) Aries Aries loves other people's drama The Aries personality comes in at the halfway point because they have two important stances on drama. Aries people love watching other people's drama play out, but hate personally experiencing drama. 7) Sagittarius Drama is too negative for Sagittarius As one of the most laid-back zodiac signs , Sagittarius doesn't really get a kick out of drama and confrontation. Sagittarians are very positive people and associate drama with negativity which is why they have no time for it. 8) Cancer Drama doesn't sit well with Cancer Cancer is one of the most sensitive zodiac signs which explains why they don't deal with drama, confrontation and criticism well. Cancer's kind and nurturing personality is incompatible with tension. 9) Aquarius Aquarius hates drama Aquarius really is a cool cucumber and hates nothing more than detecting tension and drama in the air. Aquarius only surrounds themselves with positive and likeminded people in order to avoid confrontation. 10) Taurus Taurus has no time for drama queens The Taurus personality dreams of living in a drama free world where people can look past their differences and get on peacefully. Unfortunately for Taurus this isn't the case but this zodiac definitely does everything possible to avoid dramatic people. 11) Virgo Virgo deflects drama Virgo has a reputation for being one of the most intelligent zodiac signs and it really is their acute thinking that allows them to take step back from drama and negative people. When Virgo senses drama they head for the hills! 12) Capricorn Capricorn is the least dramatic zodiac sign Capricorn vetoes drama and has an excellent conflict detector which never seems to let them down. Drama is the bane of a Capricorn's life and they absolutely hate losing energy on insignificant issues and avoid attention seekers like the plague.

Once again, Guadagnino shared how much better he felt since losing 50 pounds and adopting the high-protein, low-carb lifestyle, noting he "has energy and motivation to workout everyday." Added the MTV personality, the keto diet "helps me always have a lean and solid foundation and motivates me to workout, intermittent fast, and build on that foundation." August 8, 2019 Healthy looks good on him   and publishers took note! After dropping 50 pounds on the diet since October 2017, Jersey Shore's Vinny Guadagnino announced to his Instagram followers that he's coming out with The Keto Guido Cookbook . "I've been teasing you guys for a while, but it's time to officially announce my new book! It's called The Keto Guido Cookbook: Delicious Recipes to Get Healthy and Look Great ," the star wrote. "I'm no expert, but I found a way of life that works for me! The NUMBER ONE question I get from followers is 'Where do I begin?' So here it is…I put 100 of my favorite recipes and a 7-day meal plan into this book." July 22, 2019 Guadagnino knows it's not about how long it takes you to lose weight and tone up   it's about how sustainable the method is. Posting side-by-side shirtless photos on Instagram from the beginning of his keto journey to present day, he wrote, "I've always been able to get from left to right in a matter of months by committing to almost ANY diet and workout plan. But after being done with those miserable diets and workout plans I would always go back from right to left." Following the keto diet, however, allowed him to maintain his sleek physique for "about 4-5 years now," he wrote. "How did I do that? Basically flipping the traditional food pyramid upside down and finding a way of eating that's enjoyable, satisfying, healthy, and one that never requires me to go on a 'diet.'" April 26, 2019 The Keto Guido's work has paid off and then some! Guadagnino was more cut than ever when he showed off his low body fat and high muscle tone as a special celebrity guest at the Chippendale Theatre at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. And yes, he did perform in the show. January 12, 2019 Guadagnino responded to Instagram's #10yearchallenge and #howharddidaginghityou challenges with side-by-side photos from 2009 and 2019. As he made clear, he felt in shape in the "before" photo in which he was 21 years old   it was only after that point that he began to gain weight. "I've had some fat unhealthy years in between," he explained. But now, "eating natural fat, protein, and veggies instead of processed sugar and carbs has brought me back to 21 #ketoguido." January 12, 2019 The keto lifestyle looks good on him! In another comparison shot using a current photo, the stud showed how defined his ab and chest muscles became after he changed his diet and workout plan. December 30, 2018 Following the Christmas holidays, Guadagnino celebrated getting back to the gym. "Monday and Tuesday I ate like a pig and after injecting sugar into my blood for two days I honestly was ready to get back to eating meat and vegetables," he wrote. "It's always been tough for me to work out as well in the midst of eating bad during the holidays but this time I sucked it up." The trick worked: "After the rest of the week of sweating, intermittent fasting , and eating Keto .. I feel good again." September 14, 2018 The reason for his drastically changed body is simple. "Left: bread, pasta, sugar ,fried food , low fat products," the reality star wrote. "Right: bacon, full fat cheese ,avocados , fatty steak , fatty fish, greens." He also assured followers that he's relying only on diet and exercise and that he considers keto a lifestyle, not a fad: "No steroids , no supplements," he wrote. July 16, 2018 He brought the heat in the summer of 2018! "High Carb Low Fat on the left (2015) …. Low Carb High Fat on the right (today)… and people still claim that meat causes more inflammation than sugar ‍… maybe for some but not for this #ketoguido," he wrote. May 20, 2018 Proud of his progress! In the caption for these images, Guadagnino confessed he'd "never posted a photo from when I was overweight because it always embarrassed me putting it out there to millions." Knowing it would inspire people, however, he went for it, describing the photos in his typical straightforward fashion: "On the left you have chunky Vinny . Chunky Vinny eats a lot of bread, pasta , pizza , fried food, and sugary desserts and is always hungry." Meanwhile, #ketoguido on the right "doesn't eat any bread , pasta , or grains (whole wheat or not) and no sugary foods. He reads the labels of everything he eats to make sure there aren't hidden sugars in them. He doesn't count calories, he eats fatty delicious food , grease , vegetables never feels deprived , is rarely hungry ,has a cheat meal once in a while, is full of energy and mental clarity and exercises several times a week." October 11, 2017 Guadagnino opened his account with a simple comparison shot. "Left: March/2015. Around 197 lbs. Around 25% body fat. Eating a high carbohydrate/sugary diet," he wrote. "Right: June/2016. Around 160 lbs. Around 12-13% body fat."
AAAIWuP	autos	autosresearchguides	Treat Yourself: 16 Cars That Are Worth the Splurge	See some of the best luxury sedans and more entry-level buys. Finding the right car for yourself can involve a range of factors, usually resulting in a series of compromises to get a model that's within your price range. But that doesn't always mean that the most inexpensive ride is the best way to go. You might discover that spending more up front could save you in the long run by getting better gas mileage, or just secure you a car you really enjoy driving much more than the model that was a little cheaper. But with so many options out there, it can be hard to determine where spending a little extra for that entry-level luxury car is going to end up being worth it. Fortunately, you can find plenty of answers by perusing the write-ups by a variety of different auto experts out there, cutting past the marketing and getting a clear look at which cars are pricier for a reason and which are just pricier. You'll want to take a look at some of the cars that could be worth the extra cost before you commit to buying your next ride. Last updated April 30, 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class Price: $33,495 If you think that owning a car from the iconic company long counted among the best luxury car brands is out of reach, you could be wrong. Splurging a little can mean making the A-Class yours and getting a chance to sport that legendary hood ornament   and, of course, the turbo four-cylinder engine producing 220 foot-pounds of torque directly beneath that hood ornament. "Given the car's starting price in the low $30,000s, it would be tempting to assume that Mercedes once again cut corners," the expert reviewer for Edmunds wrote. "In reality, the A-Class is worthy of its badge, and you can indeed think of it as a downsized Benz. The A 220, which is the first trim level to come out, exceeds expectations in almost every meaningful metric." Alfa Romeo Giulia Price: $39,840 Alfa Romeo might not have quite the reputation of Mercedes or BMW when it comes to the high-end car market, but the Giulia could help change some of that. With a stylish design and more power than its rivals, the Giulia offers a combination of elegance in its design and performance from its engine that makes its price tag seem hard to believe. "Alfa Romeo's triumphant return to North America has not been without stumbles, but the Giulia is absolute proof that the legendary performance brand can deliver the goods," Car and Driver reported. "An athletic chassis, rowdy turbocharged four-cylinder engine, available adaptive suspension, quick steering, and tenacious brakes make the Giulia a joy to drive   for novices and professional drivers alike." Audi A5 Sportback Price: $45,195 Sometimes, being worth the splurge is about being able to fill multiple different roles in your life. That's where the Audi A5 might make it worth dropping near $50,000 on a car. It's a smooth ride with all sorts of features and a slick design. However, with the additional room, the five-door Sportback can serve as a family car, albeit one with a very strict rule about food to maintain the luxurious interior. "It's athletic yet fuel-efficient, with progressive technology not so advanced as not to be non-user-friendly. The A5 and S5 Sportback are ideal choices for those unimpressed by the coming SUV apocalypse," reads the expert review from Kelley Blue Book. Genesis G70 Price: $35,895 If you feel like half the point of owning a nice car is everyone knowing how nice your car is, you might not appreciate this ride. Genesis doesn't have the immediate recognizability or cache that an Audi or BMW might. However, if your focus is just on the quality of the car you're in, the G70 seems to be a great way to make it well worth paying over $35,000 for a sedan. With a striking design and solid performance, this car will still probably turn heads   even if they don't recognize the emblem. "Upon first impressions, the G70 is an overwhelmingly capable car, balancing regular, speed-limit abiding commutes with exciting spirited-drive capabilities," Kristen Lee wrote for Jalopnik. "It always felt alert due to its harder ride, and the heavier and precise steering and lighter curb weight made it quick and agile." Mercedes-Benz E-Class Price: $54,495 You would need to get a lot more car for something to be "worth the splurge" at nearly $55,000, but the E-Class is here to show you what a $55,000 car really looks like. The ride is designed for comfort, with a variety of in-cabin technology and features and a smooth ride to carry you through town and country alike in luxury and comfort. "Elegantly styled inside and out, the E-class lineup pampers its occupants in the best Mercedes-Benz tradition and makes long-distance drives feel like jaunts across town," reads Car and Driver's review of the E-class. "A turbocharged four-cylinder engine is standard and provides adequate power, but the available twin-turbo V-6 is a silken, authoritative engine that we'd recommend wholeheartedly." Nissan Maxima Price: $34,945 If you want a sports car but just can't justify giving up the basic utility of a sedan, Nissan might have your back with the Maxima. The car's sporty performance is driven by a powerful V6 and it also features some nifty safety technology like rear-door alerts and intelligent forward-collision warning. And at under $35,000, the splurge here is mostly in the car you're getting, not the price you're paying. "The 2019 Nissan Maxima is a midsize sedan with a bit of twist," Edmunds reported. "Nissan differentiates the Maxima by calling it the 'four-door sports car' of the category. Now, sports car aficionados will beg to differ, but the statement does have some merit. The Maxima is typically more responsive to steering inputs than its rivals, and its standard V6 engine produces a healthy 300 horsepower." Volkswagen E-Golf Price: $32,790 Anyone interested in switching to an electric car without giving up on the popular Golf model from Volkswagen might find the e-Golf to be the compromise they need. That's because there's little to differentiate between the two versions aside from not needing to visit the gas station anymore when you own the e-Golf. So, although the quality of the car you're driving is a big part of what makes it worth the splurge, the savings on gas produced over the lifetime of the vehicle provide the sort of bottom-line value that even the driest CPA can appreciate. "If you'd prefer your electric car to be different and make a statement to other motorists about your eco-savvy attitude, the 2019 Volkswagen e-Golf is most definitely not for you," according to one of Edmund's expert reviewers. "But the normality of the e-Golf is one of its greatest strengths: It combines all the practicality, personality and familiarity of a regular Golf and subtracts the tailpipe and all of its emissions." Hyundai Kona Electric Price: $38,045 Electric vehicles might not have the best reputation outside of a Tesla at this point, but there are a lot of options out there that should prove it's not all small cars with no sizzle. The Hyundai Kona's electric version is a crossover SUV that has all of the sizzle you might want as well as enough range to do some real cruising. And with the extra interior space, that means that camping trips or beach days are well within the realm of possibilities   and without paying for gas. "The Hyundai Kona is already our favorite subcompact SUV, largely because its nimble handling and stylish design add a dash of pizazz to an affordable, practical package," Consumer Reports reported. "… [I]t has a range long enough that it should allow you to travel to work and back   and then some. It's just a practical car that happens to be electric." Chevrolet Bolt EV Price: $37,495 The Bolt has been attracting comparison to the Tesla Model 3, mostly due to the fact that they're both an effort to provide a fully electric car with over 200 miles of range in the mid-$30,000s. At this point, the Bolt appears to be winning out, if for no other reason than that you can actually buy one at that price. But that's not all the Bolt has to offer, with a zippy ride that makes driving a small hatchback feel very different than it ever has before. "It used to be that admirers of electric cars who wanted a 200-miles-plus range had to get in line for a Tesla and spend upward of $70,000," reads the review in Consumer Reports. "The new Chevrolet Bolt changes all that. … Take a turn behind the wheel and you immediately feel the Bolt's silent, instant electric torque when you tap the throttle. With the equivalent of 200-electrified horses on tap, this small hatchback accelerates with gusto and at 6.8 seconds from zero to 60 mph, it's as quick as some sports sedans." Volkswagen Golf Alltrack Price: $27,790 Yes, most of you are saying, "ANOTHER Golf?!" Well, that's just a sign of how Volkswagen really broke the mold with this model. Then it repaired that mold so that it could be mass-produced in a variety of different versions that keep delivering on great value and utility. The Golf Alltrack keeps that going, with plenty of cargo space and the capacity for handling more rugged driving when needed. If there's a better car for a family camping trip out there, most of the experts don't seem to have found it. "The Golf Alltrack is Volkswagen's response to the Subaru Outback," Car and Driver reported. "…In this case, the protégé is more accomplished than the master; the Alltrack is more pleasant to drive than the Outback, largely on the merits of the strong foundation it shares with the entire 10Best Cars winning Golf family." BMW 2-Series Price: $36,295 The Beemer is a recognizable symbol of luxury by this point, and the 2-series is a great chance to get a car with superior performance while keeping your splurging still in the "sane" category. With all of the stylish luxury you expect from a BMW, you'll get real performance from the 248-horsepower engine and enjoy the elegant interior. New for 2019 are front and rear parking sensors, forward collisions mitigation and lane-keeping assistance. "The car feels taut, quick, and eager," reads the review in Consumer Reports. "In short, it's a joy to drive. Same goes for lesser versions of the 2 Series, which still manage to be tons of fun despite having less power." Mazda MX-5 Miata Sport Price: $26,625 The sporty little Miata has been a mainstay in the garages of people who want the experience of driving a sports car without necessarily paying sports car prices. And if the reviews are any indication, the 2019 entry does nothing to disrupt this legacy   finding another 26 horsepower for the 2019 version and raising the redline from 6,800 rpm to 7,500 rpm. And if you really enjoy driving, you can get one with six-speed manual transmission to really get the most out of your weekend jaunts around winding roads. "Since 1990, Mazda took the idea of the charmingly eccentric British roadster and infused it with Japanese reliability," reads Consumer Reports' review. "By remaining true to its nature of fun and affordable performance, the Miata has thrilled and inspired hundreds of thousands of buyers, from money-conscious workaday drivers to weekend racers." Chevrolet Camaro Price: $25,995 If you're going to opt for a high-performance sports car, it's important to get the sense that the driving experience will match the cost. And since the mid-1960s, the Camaro has been the personification of that. If you're worried that the 2019 version is going to underwhelm in the face of the model's legacy of making the sort of muscle cars you'll longingly reminisce about in your 60s, you might be wrong, as 2019 appears to bring all of the thunder and lighting of the past to the table. "With a profile that harkens back to the 1967 original, the sixth-generation Camaro looks pleasingly familiar, marking a subtle styling evolution over the previous model," Consumer Reports reported. "But don't let that fool you. The new Camaro is a delight to drive, with dynamic prowess that can give even snooty European sportsters a run for their money." Ford Mustang Price: $27,490 If you've decided to splurge on a muscle car with some serious get-up-and-go, the Ford Mustang is one option that auto experts believe won't disappoint. The 310 horsepower put out by the four-cylinder, 2.3-liter Turbo ranks first in its class, meaning this is no muscle car that's short on the muscle. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's only for weekends, as the five-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicates, you shouldn't second guess using it to pick up the kids if they don't mind squeezing into a coupe. "Unlike many sporty cars and coupes, the Mustang can serve as a daily driver without severely compromising visibility, ease of access, or drivability," reads Consumer Reports' review of the car. Audi A4 Price: $38,395 Audi has a reputation for combining style, performance and the latest technology into one sleek package. And with the A4, it appears to have hit the mark once again. Featuring a virtual cockpit full of digital displays and adaptive cruise control, the car is built to make your driving experience as pleasant as possible. "Those who say the sedan is dead haven't driven a 2019 Audi A4," wrote the expert reviewer on Kelley Blue Book. "If they had, they'd understand not all 4-doors are created equal. Even in the luxury-performance space it occupies, the A4 excels over rivals with a sophisticated exterior, luxurious interior and some of the coolest high-tech advances on the market. Toss in the A4's excellent ride and handling abilities and you have a sedan that can run circles around not only the competition, but most small SUVs." Toyota Avalon Hybrid Price: $36,580 For someone on the hunt for a car that offers a lot of space and size but won't break the bank for gas, the Toyota Avalon Hybrid might be the pick for you. Built for comfort, the car should make long road trips with the family that much more manageable, not to mention a lot cheaper when you factor in the 43 mpg combined that it gets. "The hybrid version, in particular, offers more room, comfort, and fuel efficiency for the money," reported Consumer Reports, which named the Avalon the best large car of 2019. "The spacious, richly furnished cabin has an upscale feel, with soft materials, intricate stitching, and other tasteful details. The front seats are wide and supportive, and the rear has generous legroom and available heated seats."

AAATrPi	finance	finance-savemoney	7 Ways You Can Save on Gas	American drivers love their cars but loathe the cost of gas. Whether prices at the pump are rising, falling or holding steady, fueling up is often one of the biggest household budget-busters. Fortunately, there are ways to fight back. Even small savings can be a boon for you. With that in mind, we present the best ways to save money on gas every time you pull up to the pump. 1. Use a smartphone app Technology has been a benefit to frugal folks everywhere. Finding the best deal on clothing, restaurants and grocery items has never been easier. Your smartphone also can help you find the best deal on gas. For example, the app GasBuddy can help you uncover the lowest gas price in your area. And such savings can be large. I have found that prices in the area near my Colorado home can differ by as much as 19 cents per gallon from one gas station to another. It's not the usual blah, blah, blah. Click here to sign up for our free newsletter. 2. Break your bad driving habits Accelerating quickly and braking hard can lower your gas mileage by roughly 15% to 30% at highway speeds and 10% to 40% in heavy traffic. So learning to avoid such maneuvers can significantly reduce the amount of gas you use and thus enable you to buy gas less often. Related: The Shortest Path to an Amazing Retirement 3. Open a gas rewards credit card This works best for people who always go to the same gas station. If you exhibit such loyalty, applying for the appropriate credit card can net you substantial savings on gas prices over the course of a year. Of course, that assumes you pay off your bill in full every month, avoiding interest charges. If you do, use a free online resource like Money Talks News' credit card search tool to explore gas rewards credit cards. Select "Gas Rewards" from the menu on the left to limit the search results to that type of card. 4. Don't buy premium gas unless it's required A 2018 AAA report found that drivers collectively waste $2.1 billion per year on high-octane gas. In other words, they paid extra for premium gas even though it wasn't required or even recommended for their cars. AAA advises saving your money and only buying premium gas if your car requires it. In fact, paying for premium when it's not required is one of the mistakes we cite in " The 3 Worst Money Mistakes You Make at Gas Stations ." 5. Avoid filling up over the weekend Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the three worst days of the week to buy gas , as far as cost is concerned, according to a recent GasBuddy analysis. Related: 7 Real Ways to Save on Your Car Costs If possible, fill up on Mondays. In most states, gas prices are lower on Mondays than on any other day. (Article continues after video.) 6. Take advantage of grocery fuel programs Some grocery stores reward their shoppers with fuel perks programs that can cut the cost of your next fill-up. Check with your favorite food seller. For example, sign up at Kroger , and you earn 1 fuel point for every $1 you spend. Even better, you get twice the points when you buy gift cards. You can then use the points to net savings on gas at Kroger Fuel Centers. 7. Join a warehouse club Warehouse clubs such as Costco, BJ's and Sam's Club sell gas to members. It is often   though not always   among the lowest-priced gas in town. That's why we include gas in our " 10 Best Buys at Warehouse Clubs ." This option especially makes sense for shoppers who, like me, know they will visit or at least drive by their warehouse club at least once weekly.

Nor can you specifically spot-reduce fat from around your belly area; you'll need to target body fat as a whole. Consistent diet and exercise play a role in this, but it's true that some workouts do burn fat faster and more efficiently than others. (Though you'll need to stick to a healthy diet, like this two-week clean eating plan , to be able to see those effects.) Cardio Isn't the Fastest Way to Lose Belly Fat So what's the best workout for burning fat, fast? You might think it's cardio - heart-pumping, sweat-inducing cardio like running, cycling, or swimming. But although cardio plays a big role in a healthy lifestyle , it's not the most effective way to shed fat. According to two trainers, that title goes to resistance training, especially the kind that involves high-intensity circuits. The combination of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training is seriously effective, according to certified personal trainer Ashley Kelly , NASM, who trains clients for Bach in New York City. Essentially, she told POPSUGAR, you're "performing a set of exercises designed to strengthen specific body parts, with little to no rest between exercises." It's a pretty simple formula: you build muscle through strength training, either with weights or bodyweight exercises, and you max out your heart rate by doing it in fast, intense circuits. Or, as Angelo Grinceri , FAFS, head trainer at Performix House in NYC and Ladder personal training coach, puts it: "Resistance training with an elevated heart rate is the fastest way to lose fat." (Use this guide to calculate your target heart rate .) Why Is HIIT Better Than Cardio For Burning Belly Fat? What makes HIIT so much more effective? It comes down to the muscle-building aspect. Although cardio does wonders at getting your heart rate up, it doesn't engage or build muscles the way HIIT and resistance training does; in fact, cardio can actually break muscle down if you do too much of it without proper fuel. With high-intensity resistance training, on the other hand, the whole point is to build muscle. Not only do you burn major calories throughout the workout, thanks to your elevated heart rate, but you'll also keep burning them throughout the day. "There is a direct correlation between an individual's muscle mass and how many calories he or she burns," Ashley told POPSUGAR. "Muscle burns fat even when you are resting." The more muscle you have, the higher your resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the more calories you'll burn even when you're 'chilling on the couch' sedentary," Ashley explained. How Often Should You Do Resistance Training and Cardio to Burn Belly Fat? What does all of this mean for your workout schedule? Both Ashley and Angelo recommended balancing your cardio and resistance training throughout the week, because even though cardio isn't the fastest way to burn fat, it's still majorly important for your overall health; a 2016 study from the Journal of Internal Medicine showed that cardio like walking, stair-climbing, cycling, and swimming decreases type 2 diabetes, some cancers, falls, osteoporotic fractures, and depression . Incorporating both cardio and resistance training also decreases your risk of injury. Angelo said his clients have found fat-burning success by doing resistance training at least twice a week , alongside cardio workouts two to three times a week. Ashley's ideal schedule, depending on the person, upped the resistance training to three times a week, with two days of cardio and two rest days. They both agreed, though, that you should do at least 30 minutes of cardio, four to five days a week. "It doesn't have to be max effort," Angelo said. "But challenge yourself!" Ready to get started? Grab some weights and head over to our four-week workout plan for weight loss and building muscle for the perfect balance of strength training and cardio.

AAApGH7	health	wellness	Study finds 4 main personality types   which one are you?	People love learning about their personalities and take tests hoping to reveal what type they are. Yet, experts have long said personality types are mythical: Personality exists along a continuum. Though a recent study is debunking that idea. A study published in Nature Human Behaviour reveals that there are four personality types   average, reserved, role-model and self-centered   and these findings might change the thinking about personality in general. "Whether or not these models become the definitive personality type model, it is a step forward," Jonathan Adler, an associate professor of psychology at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts, who wasn't involved in the research, told TODAY. Different traits help to predict your personality type. Researchers at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, in Illinois, examined data from 1.5 million participants who answered questionnaires about the "big five" personality traits. These five traits are commonly accepted to be major indicators of personality. As they looked at the data it appeared that people clustered around four different areas, and those emerged as the different personalities. "The findings suggest there are types," Luis Amaral, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering and an author of the paper told TODAY. "These (types) are sort of more of an attractor for these personality traits." People fall into a type based on how they rate on those five traits. People fall into one of the four types based on how they rank on the big five personality traits: openness, agreeableness, extraversion , neuroticism and contentiousness. Understanding how high or low someone ranks on each of the traits can be useful and predict things about people, such as their risk of mental illness or likelihood of divorcing. But it's not an exact science. "Everyone has variation on the big five," Adler explained. "Personality is not categorical. It is dimensional." The four personality types include: Average: The most common type are people who are high in neuroticism and extraversion while lower in openness. Reserved: People in this type are not open or neurotic but they are emotionally stable. They tend to be introverted, agreeable and conscientious. Role-models: These people are natural leaders with low levels of neuroticism and high levels of agreeableness, extraversion, openness and conscientiousness. They listen to new ideas and are reliable. Self-centered: While these people score high in extraversion they rank below average openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. "The way for you to grow is to know about yourself," Amaral said. Plus, the researchers found that personality isn't static. People evolve. Teen boys tend to be overly represented in self-centered personality while older people make up a large portion of the role models. "Certain facets are changing," Amaral said. "As people mature and grow, their personality also matures and grows. I think there is a positive message that people mature and they move to more desirable characteristics." These personality types describe healthy people. Even though it might sound bad to be neurotic, average people experience varying levels of neuroticism. "We shouldn't think about each one of the characteristics as the higher, the better. If you are extremely open minded, that just means you believe everything," Amaral said. Future research might examine people with mental illness to see if they also fall within these types or if more types emerge. People interested in learning more about their personality can do so here .

AAB207a	health	weightloss	These Simple Diet Changes Helped This Guy Lose 75 Pounds in 9 Months	At his heaviest, Matthew Izzo couldn't bring himself to step onto the scale. His best guess is that he probably weighed around 250 pounds. What he knows for certain: He didn't feel good about himself, though he wasn't fully aware of it at the time. "Looking back, it's a night and day difference, but part of our brain always craves comfort, so you may not realize you feel as bad as you do," he says. Izzo, 36, who works as a supervisor for Dish Network in Roseland, New Jersey, says the turning point that led him to get back in shape arrived over Labor Day weekend about three years ago. Izzo and his girlfriend, Courtney, had overindulged a bit-as people have the right to do over a holiday weekend-and neither of them could sleep. "The part of me that knew I had to make changes took control that night," he says. The next morning, Izzo challenged himself to run a mile-and he got through it. While it counted as progress, deep down, Izzo knew a mile here and there wasn't going to cut it if he wanted to get back in shape. After all, he'd been regularly hitting his daily 10,000-step goals, but without much of a noticeable impact on the scale or in the mirror. Like so many people who reach a weight loss plateau, Izzo had to face a hard truth: The problems were in the kitchen, too. So, he began to do his research: He logged his food, and eventually, he got over his fear of the scale. He also joined a gym, and started to incorporate principles of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 framework . "I love how it promotes compound exercises and offers a lot of flexibility," he says. He also-we swear!-says he did routines from the Men's Health Book of Muscle . "Years ago, I had done part of the beginner program and gave up before finishing. It was important to me that I finally complete it," he says. Then he turned back to his diet, distilling his eating habits down to some healthy, no-frills basics. For breakfast, that meant steel-cut oatmeal. Lunch was a turkey and ham sandwich. Dinner? Some kind of lean animal protein, quinoa, and veggies. Nice and easy. He also allowed himself three snacks per day-trying to stick to healthy bars, nuts, and fruits. Perhaps more importantly, he cut out booze, too. In addition to his daily walks, Izzo also started to incorporate HIIT-style cardio sessions, as well as regular weight training. "I had a pretty good idea what I was doing," he says. "It wasn't a question of motivation, which comes and goes-you can't control it. What I did was I set a goal and focused on it almost exclusively for about nine months." In that time, Izzo lost roughly 75 pounds, completing a dramatic weight loss transformation. (Better yet, his girlfriend, Courtney, joined him every step of the way, achieving an almost identical pound-for-pound weight loss.) By mid-2017, Izzo had reached his goal of 160 pounds, and with the physical change came improvements to his self-image. "I feel great as a result, and the harder I push myself physically the better I feel," he says. As a result, he adds, he's also taken steps to improve his mental health, and feels happier and more confident than he has in years. Now he hopes to help other people achieve the same outcome. "Deep down, I think we all know what the right things to do are," he says. "Unfortunately there are no quick fixes or easy solutions-it takes time and commitment. You will have to give up many of your past habits. But if you set a goal, work out a plan, and make the necessary adjustments, you will be successful."

AAB2A5c	finance	finance-insurance	Pet Insurance Can Be Your Wallet's Best Friend	Annie Dinwiddie's dog Rosie is 181 pounds of pure love. But all the love in the world won't cover the nearly $25,000 in vet bills Dinwiddie has racked up since she got her pup. Thankfully, pet insurance will. On a recommendation, Dinwiddie enrolled Rosie, an English mastiff, in a policy with Healthy Paws. Four years, two surgeries and countless X-rays, prescriptions and physical therapy sessions later, that decision has saved her around $18,000. "It's been a game changer," says Dinwiddie who, at the time, was in graduate school. "Every dog I have, I'll always have insurance." Most dog owners don't have thousands of dollars sitting around to cover surgery or cancer treatment. That's where pet insurance comes in. Policies typically reimburse 70% to 90% of covered costs related to illness and injury. Having that coverage allows you to make decisions about your pet's care based on its well-being, not your wallet, says Barry Kipperman, a veterinary specialist in internal medicine. "In my experience, when pet owners say they're covered by insurance, it takes the emotional angst out of the equation," Kipperman says. "There's no crying. There's no Kleenex. The animal simply gets what it needs." Here's what you need to know and what you should look for when shopping for a pet policy. What to know You still pay out of pocket. Unlike human health insurance, most pet insurance policies reimburse you rather than pay the bill upfront. So you pay for the treatment, submit the claim and receive a check for the covered portion. Routine, preventive care is an add-on. Vaccinations, flea and tick treatments and annual exams are all expected parts of pet ownership . But this type of routine care is not covered by most pet insurance policies. Some providers offer it as an upgrade or add-on. Do the math to make sure it's worth the added cost. Office visit charges usually aren't included. If your dog is sick or injured, your policy will likely cover diagnostic tests, such as bloodwork and X-rays, and any prescribed medication. But most policies don't cover the visit itself, so you're on the hook for the exam fee. A handful of providers, including Figo and Pets Best, include exam fees in some or all of their policies. You aren't covered on Day One. Most policies have a waiting period, so your pup typically isn't covered the day you enroll. And there may be different gaps for different types of coverage or conditions. Some policies, for example, won't cover claims for hip dysplasia, a common condition, within the first year. What to look for in a pet policy There are a few things you want to make sure you're covered for, says Nicole Ellis, a certified professional dog trainer with Rover, a pet-care app. Continuous coverage for chronic conditions Cancer. Arthritis. Allergies. Kidney disease. These are not short-term conditions, and treatment can last for the life of your pet. You want to ensure you're covered for the duration of the condition. "Make sure you're covered not only in the year the pet was diagnosed," Ellis says. "If you need medication every month for the rest of its life, you want to make sure it's not just covered for that year." Hereditary conditions Some breeds are prone to certain issues   Great Danes and boxers are prone to heart disease, for example, and pugs, shih tzus and other smushed-faced dogs often have breathing issues. Research any breed-specific ailments and make sure they're covered by your policy before you enroll. Alternative treatments The medical care available for dogs now rivals that of humans, including services like acupuncture and chiropractic care. If you want the full range of options, make sure these alternative treatments are covered by your plan. Deductibles and benefit limits Annual deductibles are standard for human health insurance, but the same isn't true for pet policies. With some companies, the deductible is per incident or condition. So if your dog sprains a knee, you pay one deductible and any subsequent care related to that issue is covered. But if your pup has a different issue   dental, stomach, allergies   you have to pay another deductible. There are benefits to incident deductibles, though, notes Carol Edwards, executive director of Early Alert Canines, which trains medical alert dogs for insulin-dependent diabetics. Insurance covered 90% of the costs, minus a $1,000 deductible, when Edwards' black Lab went through cancer treatment. "Years later, his cancer came back," Edwards says. "Since the deductible was already paid, his follow-up care was covered." Some policies also cap the amount they'll pay out annually, per incident and over the life of your pet.

AAB2vyJ	lifestyle	lifestylemindandsoul	Do You Hate Meditating? So Do These People, But They Do It Anyway	We all know we should meditate; from mitigating chronic pain to easing the physical symptoms of anxiety , meditation has long been touted as a panacea for the people. In fact, meditation is the fastest-growing health trend in the U.S. , and with new apps and retreats being introduced every day, it doesn't look like it's slowing down anytime soon. May is National Meditation Month , and it's easy to see why. In addition to helping with stress , studies have shown that meditation can help improve immune function , promote increased longevity , and reduce blood pressure , says Dr. Will Cole, functional medicine expert and author of Ketotarian . "Meditation actually has a variety of benefits for your health beyond just reduced stress, which is still important, due to the fact that stress can both trigger and perpetuate health problems," Cole said. Okay, so meditation is kind of like eating your leafy greens. We get it. Here's the real question, though: What if you absolutely hate meditating? What if every time you sit down on your yoga mat, you sweat and twitch while thinking about your massive pile of dirty laundry? Is it even worth your time? Or should you just skip it all together and go wash your laundry instead? Here's the secret: Meditation is difficult for everyone, according to Dr. Subhadra Evans, a researcher and lecturer at Deakin University in Australia. "The mind is by nature incredibly restless," Evans said. "By sitting with the breath, or whatever anchor we are using in meditation, we learn to allow those feelings to be present, and to pass. This eventually brings a sense of peace." Just like learning any new skill, meditation takes time and practice. In other words, don't dive into a weeklong silent retreat the first time meditation even crosses your mind. Instead, start with just a few minutes a day, said Dr. Megan Jones Bell, Chief Science Officer at Headspace . "We liken the brain to a muscle: It's similar to when you've been lifting weights," Bell said. "You may have sore muscles and use a foam roller to dig into your muscles for relief. While it's uncomfortable, it's helping the muscles heal and get stronger." Plus, if you're extra resistant to meditation, you may need to do it even more; let's face it, the Dalai Lama probably doesn't struggle with road rage. In fact, those who are most resistant to meditation may benefit the most from practicing it, said Dr. Kristina Hallett, a board certified specialist in clinical psychology and a Fellow of the American Academy of Clinical Psychology. "When someone is constantly under external stress, their nervous system stays on 'high alert' and this increases the likelihood of feeling agitated and feelings of restlessness and anxiety," Hallett said. "Meditation is like having a drink of water on a hot summer day, as it allows the brain to start to 'cool down' and return to equilibrium." At the end of the day, maybe learning how to sit with discomfort is the whole point of meditation. Still, that can sound pretty unappealing, especially if you're feeling uneasy to begin with. So, how can you incorporate meditation into your life without it feeling like a root canal? We talked to five every day women who shared their top tips on mastering meditation, especially if you actually kind of hate it. Make sure you have a variety of tools in your toolkit "To be clear, I'm not a person who enjoys meditating! I don't look forward to it, I don't even like setting aside time to meditate. However, I've noticed that with habitual meditation, I'm a different person   I'm calmer, I can handle stress better, I'm perhaps kinder and more aware of others. I do transcendental meditation two times a day for 20 minutes, morning and afternoon. For quicker calming techniques I use breath work, and I carry some lavender oil   my favorite scent   to help me chill out."  Monk, 29 Find a practice that fits your mood "I've come to find a meditation practice that works for me and my depression and anxiety, but it took a long time to get there. I've realized I do much better with a moving meditation, and yoga is best for me to do that. I can also get there with a walk, but not quite as well as yoga. I've used apps before and they help me sleep when traveling, but that's about it. I also realized in a mindfulness class that I absolutely cannot 'relax' or 'let go' when a guided meditation is led by a man's voice."  Ali, 37 Remember that it all starts with breathing "Take four breaths in the morning when you wake up and at night before sleeping. With those breaths, try to breathe in slowly over a count of four, hold your breath gently for four counts, breathe out over a count of four, and hold your breath out over four counts. I find that a simple breathing exercise can help clear the mind in just a few moments. If you enjoy the way it feels, take a few minutes during the day to repeat the same breathing exercise. The next time you mindlessly go to pick up your phone, gently close your eyes (if you're somewhere safe to do so), and try to focus on the sensations of your surroundings from the sounds, to smells, to the way the light touches your eyelids."  Zoë, 28 Meditate on the go "Even if I just meditate for a few minutes every day I'm able to manage my anxiety and stress better. Start with one- or two-minute meditations for a couple weeks every day to more easily integrate it into your routine. Set an alarm and do it at the same time every day. Take five minutes in a conference room, the bathroom or outside and do a quick meditation to refresh and clear your head."  Sarah, 22 Take the time to make meditation a habit "For me, meditation is like exercise. I don't see the point in doing something unless I see the results, but the crappy thing is, it's called a practice for a reason. You gotta practice, even through the bad days, if you wanna see results. I started going to a Vedic meditation class because I felt unfulfilled with the apps. With the apps, it just didn't fit me, and no one wants to walk around in shoes that don't fit. I'd happily go barefoot than wear a pair of heels, but Vedic meditation is my comfortable pair of Vans."

AAB2xDg	lifestyle	lifestyleshopping	8 Foundations That Actually Work For Acne-Prone Skin	When you have acne-prone skin , finding the right foundation is hard   and when you finally do, you never want to let it go. The process of scouting the perfect formula in the first place means paying close attention to a few qualifiers: level of coverage, texture, finish, and the potential for clogging pores. That's where the term "non-comedogenic" comes in. "'Non-comedogenic' is a term used to describe a product that will not block pores and promote acne," says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital. Not to be confused with oil-free products   as most, but not all oil-free products are also non-comedogenic, Dr. Zeichner explains   non-comedogenic translates to being free of pore-clogging ingredients, whereas oil-free applies to products that do not contain petrolatum , but can still contain alternative oils. Most dermatologists do stand by the recommendation to look for non-comedogenic formulas, but the claim itself is actually flawed: There is no approved industry regulation for that label. Some brands place the term on their products based only on the fact that they don't contain certain individual ingredients known to block pores, without actually testing to prove that the formula doesn't cause breakouts. That s why it s crucial to still look at the ingredients list, even if the the product boasts the non-comedogenic claim. To help cut down on the time you spend deciphering the itty-bitty print on the back of the bottle, we've researched the products that don't just say they're non-comedogenic, but actually don't include common skin-clogging culprits (like petrolatum, which Dr. Zeichner says is the biggest offender). The best non-comedogenic foundations on the market, ahead. This long-lasting, buildable formula is both non-pore-clogging and oil-free, so it never feels heavy or greasy. The ingredients that are included, like coconut water and alpine rose, actively work to hydrate and strengthen the skin.

"Annual results from 2018 suggest that despite significant challenges and recent enrollment declines, insurers in the individual insurance market are now generally profitable," Cynthia Cox, Rachel Fehr and Larry Levitt wrote. "Insurer financial results from 2018 … reveal the most favorable year in the ACA-compliant market's history." The strong results were driven in part by a big increase in premium prices in 2018, spurred by considerable uncertainty about the effects of Trump administration's efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, the report said. Potentially problematic issues included the enforcement of the individual mandate, the payment of cost-sharing subsidies, the reduction in outreach spending and the possibility that the ACA would be revoked entirely. As it turns out, the markets were more stable than some analysts had predicted, and the premium hikes were more than enough to cover increased costs. Average premiums per enrollee rose by 26% but claims rose by just 7%, boosting average gross margins to a record $167 per enrollee (see the chart below). In the wake of this sharp uptick in profitability, insurers are expected to pay roughly $800 million in rebates to more than 3 million enrollees. The ACA's medical loss ratio standard requires most insurance companies to spend at least 80% of their premium income on health care and pay refunds to enrollees if profit, marketing and administrative expenses exceed 20%. The bottom line: The report concludes that while "markets in some parts of the country remain more fragile, the individual market on average is becoming more profitable. Some insurers have exited the market in recent years, but others have been successful and expanded their footprints, as would be expected in a competitive marketplace. … While signups through the marketplace during the 2019 open enrollment period declined somewhat compared to 2018, financial results suggest the market is still stable and sustainable."
